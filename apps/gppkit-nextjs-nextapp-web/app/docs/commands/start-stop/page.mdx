# gpp start/stop

Control platform development servers from anywhere in your project.

## Start

Start a platform's development server.

### Usage

```bash
# From project root
gpp start <platform>

# From within a platform directory
gpp start
```

### Examples

```bash
# Start web platform
gpp start web

# Start API platform
gpp start api

# Auto-detect platform (from apps/web/)
cd apps/web
gpp start
```

## Stop

Stop a running platform.

### Usage

```bash
gpp stop <platform>
gpp stop
```

## Restart

Restart a platform's development server.

### Usage

```bash
gpp restart <platform>
gpp restart
```

## Build

Build a platform for production.

### Usage

```bash
gpp build <platform>
gpp build
```

## Dev

Run platform in development mode (alias for start).

### Usage

```bash
gpp dev <platform>
gpp dev
```

## Log

View platform logs.

### Usage

```bash
gpp log <platform>
gpp log
```

## Platform Detection

When no platform is specified, GPP auto-detects based on:

1. Current working directory (if inside `apps/<platform>/`)
2. Platform configuration in `.gpp/deploy.json`

## Custom Scripts

Override default scripts in `.gpp/deploy.json`:

```json
{
  "platforms": {
    "web": {
      "scripts": {
        "start": "npm run dev -- --port 3001",
        "build": "npm run build && npm run export"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Running Multiple Platforms

Open multiple terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1
gpp start web

# Terminal 2
gpp start api
```

Or use a process manager like PM2 or Docker Compose for more complex setups.
