# gpp verify

Verify GPP project structure and naming conventions.

## Usage

```bash
gpp verify [platform] [options]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `platform` | Specific platform to verify (optional) | No |

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-v, --verbose` | Show detailed verification output |

## What It Checks

### Project Structure

- `.gpp/` directory exists with valid config files
- `apps/` directory structure matches GPP conventions
- Required files present (`config.json`, `deploy.json`)

### Naming Conventions

GPP enforces a consistent naming convention for platform directories:

```
apps/<project>-<stack>-<framework>-<platform>/
```

Examples:
- `apps/myapp-nextjs-nextapp-web/`
- `apps/myapp-python-fastapi-api/`
- `apps/myapp-flutter-material-mobile/`

### Platform Configuration

- Each platform in `deploy.json` has a matching directory
- Environment templates exist in `env/`
- Docker configuration valid (if applicable)

## Examples

### Verify entire project

```bash
gpp verify
```

Output:
```
Checking project structure...
✓ .gpp/config.json exists
✓ .gpp/deploy.json exists
✓ apps/ directory exists

Checking naming conventions...
✓ apps/myapp-nextjs-nextapp-web/ follows convention
✓ apps/myapp-python-fastapi-api/ follows convention

Checking platform configuration...
✓ web platform configured correctly
✓ api platform configured correctly

All checks passed!
```

### Verify specific platform

```bash
gpp verify web
```

### Verbose output

```bash
gpp verify --verbose
```

Shows detailed information about each check, including:
- File paths being checked
- Configuration values being validated
- Suggestions for fixing issues

## Common Issues

### Naming Convention Violations

If a directory doesn't follow the naming convention:

```
✗ apps/frontend/ does not follow GPP naming convention
  Expected: apps/<project>-<stack>-<framework>-<platform>/
  Suggestion: Rename to apps/myapp-nextjs-nextapp-web/
```

### Missing Configuration

```
✗ Platform 'api' in deploy.json has no matching directory
  Expected: apps/myapp-python-fastapi-api/
```

### Fix with gpp convert

If you have an existing project that doesn't follow conventions:

```bash
gpp convert plan
gpp convert apply
```

This will restructure your project to match GPP conventions.
